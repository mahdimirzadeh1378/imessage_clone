For running the app just run the `flutter pub get` and everything is good to go

This project tried to use riverpod structure like this article:

I try not to use any packages, we have only three packages: `riverpod`, `equitable`, `flutter_svg` for simplicity.

We can also move the messages in a memory storage in a separate file, but I keep it in our controller.
